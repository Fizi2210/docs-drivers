== Authentication methods


=== Basic authentication

The basic authentication scheme relies on traditional username and password.
These can either be the credentials for your local installation, or the ones provided with an Aura instance.

[source, go]
----
driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(
    dbUri,
    neo4j.BasicAuth(dbUser, dbPassword, ""))
----

[INFO]
The basic authentication scheme can also be used to authenticate against an LDAP server (Enterprise Edition only).


=== Kerberos authentication

The Kerberos authentication scheme requires a base64-encoded ticket.
It can only be used if the server has the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/kerberos-add-on/current/deployment/[Kerberos Add-on installed].

[source, go, test-skip]
----
driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.KerberosAuth(ticket))
----


=== Bearer authentication

The bearer authentication scheme requires a base64-encoded token provided by an Identity Provider through Neo4j's link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/sso-integration[Single Sign-On feature].

[source, go, test-skip]
----
driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.BearerAuth(token))
----

[NOTE]
The bearer authentication scheme requires link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/sso-integration[configuring Single Sign-On on the server].
Once configured, clients can discover Neo4j's configuration through the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/http-api/current/endpoints/#discovery-api[Discovery API].


=== Custom authentication

Use the function link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j#CustomAuth[`CustomAuth`] to log into a server having a custom authentication scheme.


=== No authentication

Use the function link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j#NoAuth[`NoAuth`] to access a server where authentication is disabled.

[source, go, test-skip]
----
driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.NoAuth())
----

== Rotating authentication tokens

It is possible to rotate authentication tokens that are expected to expire (e.g. SSO).
You need to provide a link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j/auth#TokenManager[`TokenManager`] instance when instantiating the `Driver`, rather than a static authentication token.

The easiest way to get started is to use one of built-in implementations: link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j/auth#BasicTokenManager[`BasicTokenManager`] and link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j/auth#BearerTokenManager[`BearerTokenManager`].

.Rotating a bearer token expiring every 60 seconds
[source, go, test-skip]
----
fetchAuthTokenFromProvider := func(ctx context.Context) (neo4j.AuthToken, *time.Time, error) {
    // some way of getting a token
    token, err := getSsoToken(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return neo4j.AuthToken{}, nil, err
    }
    // assume we know tokens expire every 60 seconds
    expiresIn := time.Now().Add(60 * time.Second)
    // include a little buffer so that we fetch a new token before the old one expires
    expiresIn = expiresIn.Add(-10 * time.Second)
    // or return nil instead of `&expiresIn` if we don't expect it to expire
    return token, &expiresIn, nil
}

// create a new driver with a bearer token manager
_, _ = neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, auth.BearerTokenManager(fetchAuthTokenFromProvider))
----

[NOTE]
This API should not be used for switching users. Auth managers should always return tokens for the same identity.
You can switch users at both xref:query-simple.adoc#impersonation[query level] and xref:transactions.adoc#impersonation[session level].

[WARNING]
`TokenManager` implementations and providers must not interact with the driver in any way, as this can cause deadlocks and undefined behavior.


== Custom address resolver

When creating a `DriverWithContext` object, you can specify a _resolver_ function to resolve the connection address the driver is initialized with.
Note that addresses that the driver receives in routing tables are not resolved with the custom resolver.
Your resolver function is called with a link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j/config#ServerAddress[`ServerAddress`] object and should return a list of link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j/config#ServerAddress[`ServerAddress`] objects.

.Connection to `example.com` on port `9999` is resolved to `localhost` on port `7687`
[source, go]
----
// import "github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j/config"

driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(
    "neo4j://example.com:9999", neo4j.BasicAuth(dbUser, dbPassword, ""),
    func(conf *config.Config) {
        conf.AddressResolver = func(address config.ServerAddress) []config.ServerAddress {
            return []config.ServerAddress{
                neo4j.NewServerAddress("localhost", "7687"),
            }
        }
})
defer driver.Close(ctx)
----

You can find all `DriverWithContext` configuration parameters in the link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j/config#Config[API documentation -> config package].
