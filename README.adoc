== Usage

First, set up your environment.

If this is your first time, make a copy of _devenv.local.template_ called _devenv.local_.
Fill in the necessary values.

Source the common _devenv_: `source devenv`.

Build stuff by running `./gradlew <task>`, for example `./gradlew build`.
Run `./gradlew tasks --all` to see all available tasks.
